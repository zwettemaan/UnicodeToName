# UnicodeToName

Sample ExtendScript showing how to get the Unicode name for a unicode character code

## One-time set-up

I ran the Python script to produce a precusor to the `lookup_table.json` file.

This file had too much white space in it, so I opened it in Sublime Text and 
used a Sublime Text feature to condense the JSON file by removing superfluous 
white space. 

The end result is `lookup_table.json`

The sample script `UnicodeToName.jsx` is meant to be self-explanatory.

To use this stuff, you only need the `.jsx` and the `.json`. 

The `README.md` and the Python script are not required to run this script.
